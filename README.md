# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition

## Trained on MNIST dataset

## main.py
```
It uses simple neural neywork with Stochastic Gradient Descent and Backpropogation
```
## cross-entropy-costfuntion.py
```
1. cross-entropy cost function instead of quadratic cost function L2-regularisation
2. Weights are initiazed to mean zero
```

The best efficiency I got was 98.87% with a couple of convolutional layers, a fully connected layer of 640 neurons, learning rate of 0.1

### Note : I used very small dataset to train, more likely reason for overfiiting
